 # Find the AI - Dash

Welcome to Find the AI, a game where you test your ability to distinguish quotes generated by ChatGPT from those written by humans. Can you find the AI?

## Game Description

In Find the AI, you will be presented with two quotesâ€”one from a human and one generated by ChatGPT. Your objective is to identify which quote was written by the AI. The game leverages Plotly Dash for the user interface and connects to the Quotable API to fetch human quotes. AI quotes are generated by asking ChatGPT to summarize the original quotes.
