## Description

In Find the AI, you will be presented with two quotesâ€”one from a human and one generated by ChatGPT. Your objective is to identify which quote was written by the AI. The game leverages Plotly Dash for the user interface and connects to the Quotable API to fetch human quotes. AI quotes are generated by asking ChatGPT to summarize the original quotes.

* Responses from the OpenAI API to ChatGPT are cached locally.
* Each day, new quotes are presented.
* These quotes are refreshed with a daily scheduled task located in `seed.py`.

### Deployment

Find the AI is currently deployed on [PythonAnywhere](https://machinalquotedash.pythonanywhere.com/).

## Development

This repository uses [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/) for requirements management. To run the Find the AI game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Change to the project directory:

```console
cd find-the-ai-dash
```

3. Install the required dependencies using pdm:

```console
pdm config python.use_venv false
pdm install --no-self
```

4. Run the application:

```console
pdm run dash_app/app.py
```

5. Access the game in your web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8050/`.

### OpenAI API

To run `seed.py` and populate the cache, you must add your OpenAI API Key to `.OPENAI_API_KEY`.

### Other Commands

* Tests with `pdm run pytest test`
* Lint with `pdm run black . --line-length=79` and `pdm run flake8 dash_app/ test/`
